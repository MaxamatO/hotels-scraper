#Hotels scraper

## Description

Hotels scraper is being built, just cause of my pure laiziness, to check sites like TUI, wakacje pl, ITAKA etc. for perfect hotel for holiday. I set the parameters to show 10 results of every site with: _All inclusive, good rating, high stars, Greece, Spain, September_. Results are ordered from cheapest.

Mainly looking for a **unicorn** hotel for cheap, thus these filters.

## If you want to try it

- Typescript
- Node js
- Puppeteer

### How to deploy

Just clone my repo `git clone https://github.com/MaxamatO/hotels-scraper.git`, install the dependencies and `npm run start` it. Hope it works for you.
Feel free to modify.
